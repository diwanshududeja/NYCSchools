# NYCSchools

Created the solution with the help of:

MVVM,
Flow,
Coroutines,
Compose,
Hilt,
Unit Tests



Haven't implemented School detail screen due to time constraint but we can do it in the same way.

As with this only, you can have pretty much knowledge about the architecture patterns and the code structure.
